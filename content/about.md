I’m Patrick, a software engineer. I am an associate solution engineer at [C3 AI](https://c3.ai). There I work with other solution engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to build enterprise AI/ML solutions for industry and federal clients.

I graduated from the University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in May of 2021 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. In college, I was on a research team building a tool that analyzed the abstract syntax trees with control flow graphs of WordPress plugins to look for GDPR violations. I also was a member of the Cavalier Marching Band's drumline for all four years that I attended UVA.

After college, I was a full stack developer for Doctor Fit, Health and Wellness/Hew Health. There I built, designed, and maintained their personal training and meal plan website. Notably I guided their website through MVP launch and Dockerized their entire web application.

Early in my career I mainly programed in PHP (plus MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery JS) for work. I prefer to use Python for my personal projects. I am enthusiastic about web technologies and enjoy building out web services. I also dabble in microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) and the occasional Python machine learning project.

Check out my projects that I post here. Most of my projects are also public on my GitHub.
